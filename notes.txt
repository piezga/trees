Looking at the differences between barro and wanang dataset. Wanang has aroun 230k trees but more than 100k are labelled 'unknkown".
What consequences does this have?

The community analysis looks more or less the same from 150 (100) species onward for wanang (barro)

Oddly enough Wanang seems to follow the opposite size scaling with respect to Barro
